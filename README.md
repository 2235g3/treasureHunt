# treasureHunt
A simple treasure hunt game we made as an activity in lesson. I can't remember how much guidance we received however it was one of the first big projects we made in class. 

As far as I can tell, you guess coordiantes on a board to search for coins in a set amount of moves. Once the user has run out of moves, the whole grid is shown and the users statistics are shown.
